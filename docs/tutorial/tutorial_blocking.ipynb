    "For a record `r`, a signature is a sub-record derived from record `r` with a signature strategy. An example signature strategy is to concatenate the initials of first and last name, e.g., the signature for record `\"John White\"` is `\"JW\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide the following signature strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* feature-value: the signature is generated by returning the selected feature\n",
    "* characters-at: the signature is generated by selecting a single character or a sequence of characters from selected feature\n",
    "* metaphone: the signature is generated by phonetic encoding the selected feature using metaphone\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this step is a reversed index where keys are generated signatures / blocking key and the values are list of corresponding record IDs. A record ID could be row index or the actual record identifier if it is available in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Signature strategies are defined in the `signatureSpecs` section. For example, in the above configuration, we are going to generate two signatures for each record. The first signature is a combination of 3 different signature strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "     {\"type\": \"characters-at\", \"config\": {\"pos\": [0]}, \"feature\": 1},\n",

    "*One signature corresponds to one block. I will use signature and block interchangeably but they mean the same thing.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step2 - Filter Too Frequent Signatures**\n",
    "\n",
    "A signature is assumed to identify a record as uniquely as possible. Therefore, we need to filter out some too frequent signatures since they can uniquely identify the record. On the otherside, we want to be resilient to frequency attack, so we need to filter out too rare signature that only contains very few records. The configuration of filtering is in the `filter` part. For example, in the above configuration, the filter section is configured as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \"filter\": {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"ratio\",\n",
    "        \"max\": 0.02,\n",
    "        \"min\": 0.001,\n",
    "    }\n",

    "Then we will filter out all signatures / blocks whose number of records is greater than 2% of number of total records or is less than 0.1% of number of total records. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we also support absoulte filtering configuration i.e. filter by number of counts. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \"filter\": {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"count\",\n",
    "        \"max\": 100,\n",
    "        \"min\": 5,\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step3 - Anonymization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given we want to do privacy preserving record linkage, the signatures need to be hashed to avoid leaking of PII information. The most frequent used data structure of such encoding is Bloom Filter. Here we use one Bloom Filter and map all filtered signatures into that Bloom Filter. The configuration of Bloom Filter is in `block-filter` section:\n",

    "    }\n",
